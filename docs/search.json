I’m Zheng Ren, a first-year PhD student in Biostatistics. My academic journey began with an undergraduate degree in Business and Economics from Brandeis University, followed by a master’s degree in Social Policy and Data Analytics from the University of Pennsylvania. My professional background includes a six-month internship with the United Nations and two years of experience as a full-time data analyst at Penn’s Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor (PennSIVE).\nDuring my internship at the UN, I saw firsthand how data science can play a transformative role in the health sector. We developed interactive COVID-19 dashboards to monitor disease spread and vaccine availability worldwide. This experience inspired me to apply my advanced data science skills to health-related fields. My two years of research at PennSIVE deepened my passion for neuroimaging and wearable devices. I’m particularly interested in using data science and statistical methods to analyze emerging data types, such as imaging and functional data. I also aim to contribute to user-friendly software development, making innovative methods accessible to people from diverse backgrounds."
